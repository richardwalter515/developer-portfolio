Developer Portfolio - Richard Walter

## About Me
Leveraging a background in merchandise design in conjunction with strong knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery, my goal is to create an engaging user experience that is both intuitive and visually exciting. I recently received a certificate in full-stack web development through the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I honed several skills including utilizing API data and creating dynamically updated web pages. In my previous work in both merchandise and public relations, I worked well under pressure and was focused on using consumer engagement to continually update and improve our products, skills I look forward to bringing into my work as a developer.
